# Beverages prices refactoring kata

> This repository is the Go version of *Beverages prices refactoring kata* from
[@trikitrok](https://github.com/trikitrok/beverages_pricing_refactoring_kata).

## Goal
This code computes the prices of the beverages served in our coffe house.

We'd like you to add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬
to all our existing catalog of beverages.

### Tips:
You might want to refactor the code a bit first.
